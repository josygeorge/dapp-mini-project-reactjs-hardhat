# Basic Sample Hardhat Project

# dapp-mini-project-reactjs-hardhat

## Connecting a wallet or Dapp to Hardhat Network

### This mini project demonstrates a user connection(UI using ReactJS) to a local blockchain(for demo purpose) via a wallet (like, Metamask)

1.  created a project,
2.  run a Hardhat task,
3.  compiled a smart contract,
4.  installed a Waffle integration plugin,
5.  written and run a test using the Waffle and ethers.js plugins, and 6. deployed a contract.
    This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/sample-script.js
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
npx hardhat help
```
